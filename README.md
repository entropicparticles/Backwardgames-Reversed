DEMO: Generating perlin-based procedural worlds with leaflet and web workers

Leaflet is great for exploring maps, web workers are great for procedural content, I just wanted to put it together. I got inspired by the nice work of leaflet-fractal so I started to work on top of their code (github.com/aparshin/leaflet-fractal).

I just did my first javascript code two months ago (Dec-2016, it was my first html code at all!) so probably there are infinite ways to improve the code. Sorry for that!

Do whatever you want with it, enjoy!
