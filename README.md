# REVERSED - A handcrafted 8-bit Isometric Noir Adventure in JS canvas

DEMO: An adventure game inspired in the pixelart of Batman and Head Over Hells (Jon Ritman & Bernie Drummond) and gameplay on old Lucas Art graphic adventures. 

- Handcrafted: All code is written from scratch in JS using canvas.
- 8-bit: All fits in a screen of 320x180 pixels and music is chiptuned.
- Isometric: Yeah, it is isometric.
- Noir: That is the spirit of the story.
- Adventure: Because what is life without adventures? 

Special note: The game is played backwards!! Yes, that is the reason of the name. Instead of doing things, you have to UNDO things. It sounds weird, and indeed it is! You have to unravel the secuence of events that push to your murder and why.

Enjoy!
